My Blog, for VinceLynch.com deployed on Amazon EC2 Linux Server Nodejs with Mongodb with Angular on the front. 


A would be simple blog, originally deployed using github pages and Jekyl, as it didn't really need to be a full stack web application.

I wanted to make a newsfeed in the same way that you see on Facebook, Linkedin etc where when you repost/post content it automatically grabs a screenshot, photos, videos from the webpage your reposting.

I tend to blog quite a lot, but mainly through my Facebook etc, rather than publically, and as most of what I publish is kind of Tech News,

I felt as if, deploying this on EC2 linux, with Mean, as a full stack would be better in the long run.
