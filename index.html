<p>I guess... I have come to a point in my life where I find it difficult what to say.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs said, that. Maybe, there is something you always wanted to do</p>

<p> I guess, <b>I started my life</b> with two things I knew, I knew:</p>

<p>When I was ten, I loved computers. Well, I always loved computers. Everyone thought I was a hacker or a geek. And maybe I was or wasn't it really doesnt matter anymore. But I did love Visual Basic and developed a few different games and bits and pieces on Visual Basic Studio on Windows. </p>

<p> The love of computers, was coupled with a love of philosophy and psychology</p>

<p> When I was Sixteen, I started work as a Hypnotist. Teaching and training other hypnotists. This became my expertise' for the next ten years++</p>

<p> When I was 28 years old, I was lucky that a friend, advised me, on how to alter my business processes, and got me into the world of affiliate marketing....</p>

<p> Right now, I have just finished a Web Development Immersive Bootcamp in Silicon Roundabout, London... I have finished spending 3 months making internet things.</p>
